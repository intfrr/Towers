# Towers

Playing around at writing a tower defence game. Trying a slightly new concept of having modular towers, called bunkers. A bunker can have different modules installed to alter its capabilities. Currently bunkers support a tracking device and a weapon.

Tracking devices handle target selection and relay targets to the weapon, which fires at them.

Got a reasonably good start with levels, creeps, bunkers and stuff. UI is basic but fine for now.


### TODO

 - Creep health (just get 1-shot at the mo)
 - Ability to build bunkers
  - gold for killing creeps
  - ui to handle it
 - More focus on bunkers, ability to change tracking and weapons
 - Better UI - more stuff in the panels
 - Ammo storage module
  - weapons consume ammo from storage
  - when storage is empty long cooldown to reload
 - Multiple levels
 - Better art
 - Sounds
