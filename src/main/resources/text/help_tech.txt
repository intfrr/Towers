There are three types of weapons; light, heavy and special. 
Light weapons are good for small, fast enemies. They are accurate and fast firing. 
Heavy weapons are good for large, slow enemies, or groups. They are inaccurate and slow firing, but do more damage and can damage multiple enemies. 
Special weapons tend to have unique properties. 
Each weapon can be upgraded within its own tech tree.
